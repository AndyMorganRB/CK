<p><strong>You are not alone. </strong>I know how sometimes it can feel that way, but you're not.
</p>
<p>Plenty of people have walked the path you are on before, had the same doubts, struggled with the same things as you are right now, and had setbacks. I want you to know this because it's important to believe in yourself and the process. That's why I have built out the <a href="https://rippedbody.com/results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">results page</a> with a wide variety of clients at different starting points.
</p>
<p>However, while text and pictures are good, there is nothing quite like video. So I asked some clients to share their struggles and any 'aha' moments that they had from our work together on camera.
</p>
<p>I hope you find listening to their experiences useful.

<p>Many people find that having to travel regularly for business stops them from achieving their physique goals. That does not have to be the case.
</p>
<p>James is an executive that travels internationally for business regularly. Nearly half of my clients are like James. Though this makes training and diet efforts a little more complicated, and the results longer to achieve, if you have the right attitude you will get there. The key to success is avoiding the 'all or nothing' mindset; doing what you can when you can. In this video testimonial James shares insights into his journey over the last year.
</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, we didn't include any before-after photos because James occupies a top position at a public company.

<p>"One of the biggest lessons that I learned was that when you go on a diet, about halfway through, you feel small and deflated, but if you keep at it and just let the coach do their job, the place you end up at is much more satisfying and exciting."

<p>Tariq told me that he turned 40 last week and this left my jaw on the floor. Bravo!<br>

<p>"Andy said one simple thing and it changed everything for me. 'We start by going after the optimal weight gain target. Once we have that set and we see that the calories are giving us that, then we know that we don't have to touch the food anymore. Then we deal with the training, the rest, and the stress... In my opinion, coaching is one of those life hacks that is just a no-brainer.'"

<p>"I used to weigh 350 lbs. I lost the first 100 lbs on my own by making simple, obvious adjustments to my lifestyle, such as cutting out the junk food and soda.

<p>Eventually, I hit a plateau..."
